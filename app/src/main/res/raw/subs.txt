Most of us go through life trying to do our best at whatever we do whether it's our Job, family, school or anything else.


[026000]
I feel that way. I try my best. But some time ago I came to the realisation that i wasn't getting much better at the things i cared most about whether it was being a husband or a friend or a professional or a teammate.


[040000]
And i wasn't improving much to dose thing even though I was spending a lot of time working hard at them


[047000]
I since realised from conversations i've had, and from research, this stagnation despite hard work is quite common. So i'd like to share some insight to why that is, and what we can all do about it.


[062000]
What i've learned is that the most effective people in any domain do something we can all emulate. The go through life deliberately alternating between two zones. The learning zone and the performance zone.


[077000]
The learning zone is when our goal is to improve. then we do activities designed for improvements. Concentrating on activities we haven't mastered yet. Which means we have to expect to make mistakes, knowing that we will learn from them.


[091000]
That is very different from what we do when we are in our performance zone. When our goal is to do something as best as we can. To execute. Then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes


[104000]
Both of these zones should be part of our lives, but being clear on when we want to be in each of them. With what goals  focus and expectations helps us better perform and better improve. The performance maximises our immediate performance while the learning zone maximises our growth and our future performance. 


[120000]
The reason many of us don't improve much despite our hard work is that we tend to spend almost all of our time in the performance zone.
[130000]
This hinders our growth and ironically, also over the long run, our performance.


[135000]
So what does the learning zone look like. Take demosthenes  a political leader and  the greatest order and lawyer in ancient greece.


[145000]
To become great he didn't spend all his time just being a lawyer. Which should be his performance zone. But instead he did activities designed for improvement. 


[155000]
Of course he studied alot he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors. But he also realised being a lawyer involved persuading other people. So he also studied great speeches and acting.


[170000]
To get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder he practises speeches and he suspended a sword from the ceiling. So that if he raised his shoulder it would hurt


[183000]
To speak more clearly despite a lisp he went through his speeches with stones in his mouth. He build an underground room where he could practice without interruptions or disturb other people.


[194000]
And since courts at the time we very noisy he also practiced by the ocean projecting his voice above the roar of the waves.


[204000]
His activities in the learning zone were very different from his activities in court. His performance zone. 


[210000]
In the learning zone he did what doctor anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice. This involves breaking down abilities into component skills.being clear on what subset of skill we are working to improve. Like keeping our shoulders down


[219000]
Giving full concentration to a high level of challenge outside our comfort zone just beyond what we can currently do. 


[227000]
Using frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments and ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach. Because activities designed for improvement are domain specific. And great teachers and coaches know what those activities are and can also give us expert feedback.
