1
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:15,116
It was just an ordinary Saturday.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,356
My dad was outside mowing the lawn,

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,636
my mom was upstairs folding laundry,

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,796
my sister was in her room doing homework

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,180
and I was in the basement
playing video games.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,236
And as I came upstairs
to get something to drink,

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,476
I looked out the window

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,796
and realized that there was something
that I was supposed to be doing,

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,020
and this is what I saw.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,796
No, this wasn't
my family's dinner on fire.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,460
This was my science project.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,516
Flames were pouring out,

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,756
smoke was in the air

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,996
and it looked like our wooden deck
was about to catch fire.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,836
I immediately started yelling.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,356
My mom was freaking out,

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,476
my dad ran around to put out the fire

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,636
and of course my sister
started recording a Snapchat video.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,556
(Laughter)

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,780
This was just the beginning
of my team's science project.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,956
My team is composed of me
and three other students

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,660
who are here in the audience today.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,116
We competed in FIRST LEGO League

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,676
which is an international
LEGO robotics competition for kids,

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,556
and in addition to a robotics game,

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,956
we also worked
on a separate science project,

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,676
and this was the project
that we were working on.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,676
So the idea for this project all started

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,956
when a few months earlier,

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,796
a couple of my teammates
took a trip to Central America

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,316
and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,300
or expanded polystyrene foam.

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,996
And when they came back
and told us about it,

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,716
we really started thinking about the ways
in which we see Styrofoam every day.

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,356
Get a new flat-screen TV?

36
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,340
You end up with a block of Styrofoam
bigger than the TV itself.

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,356
Drink a cup of coffee?

38
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,556
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups
are sure going to add up.

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,956
And where do all these items go
after their one-time use?

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,396
Since there aren't any good
existing solutions for used Styrofoam,

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,956
almost all of them
end up right in the landfill,

42
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,316
or the oceans and beaches,

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,036
taking over 500 years to degrade.

44
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,276
And in fact, every year, the US alone

45
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,956
produces over two billion
pounds of Styrofoam,

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,156
filling up a staggering
25 percent of landfills.

47
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,260
So why do we have these ghost
accumulations of Styrofoam waste?

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,660
Why can't we just recycle them
like many plastics?

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,636
Well, simply put, recycled
polystyrene is too expensive

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,236
and potentially contaminated,

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,476
so there is very little market demand
for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,036
And as a result, Styrofoam
is considered a nonrenewable material,

53
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,820
because it is neither feasible
nor viable to recycle polystyrene.

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,996
And in fact, many cities across the US

55
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,436
have even passed ordinances

56
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,076
that simply ban the production
of many products containing polystyrene,

57
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,156
which includes disposable utensils,

58
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,356
packing peanuts, takeout containers

59
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,516
and even plastic beach toys,

60
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,516
all products that are very useful
in today's society.

61
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,716
And now France
has become the first country

62
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,996
to completely ban all plastic utensils,

63
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,620
cups and plates.

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,516
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam

65
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,276
and keep benefiting
from its cheap, lightweight, insulating

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,036
and excellent packing ability,

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,396
while not having to suffer
from the repercussions

68
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,740
of having to dispose of it?

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,636
What if we could turn it into
something else that's actually useful?

70
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,220
What if we could make
the impossible possible?

71
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,796
My team hypothesized that we could use
the carbon that's already in Styrofoam

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,516
to create activated carbon,

73
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,900
which is used in almost
every water filter today.

74
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,916
And activated carbon works
by using very small micropores

75
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,900
to filter out contaminants
from water or even air.

76
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,836
So we started out
by doing a variety of heating tests,

77
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,940
and unfortunately, we had many failures.

78
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,996
Literally, nothing worked.

79
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,276
Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,956
most of our samples
vaporized into nothing,

81
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,396
or exploded inside expensive furnaces,

82
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,660
leaving a horribly sticky mess.

83
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,860
In fact, we were so saddened
by our failures that we almost gave up.

84
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,516
So why did we keep trying

85
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,916
when all the adults
said it was impossible?

86
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,860
Well, maybe it's because we're kids.
We don't know any better.

87
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,076
But the truth is, we kept trying
because we thought it was still possible.

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,796
We knew that if we were successful,

89
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,236
we would be helping the environment
and making the world a better place.

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,916
So we kept trying

91
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,676
and failing

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,356
and trying

93
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,956
and failing.

94
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,620
We were so ready to give up.

95
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,036
But then it happened.

96
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,756
With the right temperatures,
times and chemicals,

97
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,036
we finally got that successful test result

98
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,875
showing us that we had created
activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.

99
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,476
And at that moment,
the thing that had been impossible

100
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,740
all of a sudden wasn't.

101
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,356
It showed us that although we had
many failures at the beginning,

102
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,076
we were able to persevere through them
to get the test results that we wanted.

103
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,036
And moreover, not only were we able
to create activated carbon

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,316
for purifying water,

105
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,796
but we were also able
to reduce Styrofoam waste,

106
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,580
solving two global problems
with just one solution.

107
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,076
So from then on, we were inspired
to take our project further,

108
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,316
performing more tests
to make it more effective

109
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,676
and testing it in real world situations.

110
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,436
We then proceeded to receive funding

111
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,436
from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION
STEM-in-Action program

112
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,196
sponsored by the US Army,

113
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,596
as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards

114
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,900
sponsored by XPRIZE.

115
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,716
And we were also honored

116
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,516
with the Scientific American
Innovator Award

117
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,780
from Google Science Fair.

118
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,756
And using these funds, we plan
to file a full patent on our process

119
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,660
and to continue to work on our project.

120
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,436
So yes, although we started
with catching my dad's grill on fire

121
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,956
and failing so many times
that we almost quit,

122
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,516
it was well worth it
when we look back at it now.

123
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,356
We took a problem
that many people said was impossible

124
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,876
and we made it possible,

125
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,156
and we persevered when it looked
like nothing that we did would work.

126
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,276
We learned that you can't have success

127
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,796
without a little,

128
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,580
or a lot, of failure.

129
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,876
So in the future, don't be afraid
if your grill goes up in flames,

130
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,780
because you never know
when your idea might just catch fire.

131
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,836
Thank you.

132
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,340
(Applause)
